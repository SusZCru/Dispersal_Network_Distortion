## README

Here, you can find the open-cource ARCGIS Toolbox 'DistortionMapper'. Download this file and import .gpkx toolbox into ARCGIS to use the 'Calculate Network Distortion' Tool.

The tool requires three inputs:

-   Your baseline LCP network (.tif)

-   Your compariosn/future LCP network (.tif). The two networks must conform in crs, pixel dimensions and extent.

-   A 'Zone' raster (.tif or .lyrx). This is simply a raster where the area that your entire networks are enclosed (e.g. the country or island) is given '1' and all other pixels NA (or -9999). It must be in the same crs, pixel dimensions and extent as the networks. This is used to streamline calculation of percentile thresholds in weighting.

In this file is also includes example inputs: our low elevation, short ranging dispersal type, wet precipitation specialist (LW50000), in both a baseline (1970-2000) and severe future scenarios (2021-2040, ssp585), as well as the Zone (contiguous borneo).
