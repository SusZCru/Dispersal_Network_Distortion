## README

Here you can find the scripts for the preliminary analysis used to guide creation fo virtual species with elevation-precipitation based specialisms, as well as the large script for creating the virtual species array.

The outputs of this virtual species (the inputs for connectivity software) are saved in 'ConnectivityAlgorithm_inputs' for replication.
