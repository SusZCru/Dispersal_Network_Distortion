## README

Here, you can find the script for the sensitivity analysis of our novel network distortion metric, as well as backup of the tool (in python script).

If you would rather find the tool in a more intuitive ModelBuilder format, either download the tool in 'Download_the_Metric' and open the tool with 'edit' in ARCGIS, or view the supplement of the dissertation.
